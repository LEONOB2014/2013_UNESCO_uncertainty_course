# 2013_UNESCO_uncertainty_course
Practical and low-level introduction to uncertainty assessment of environmental models

The notes were originally created for UNESCO-IHE institute in Delft as part of a modelling course in collaboration with Johannes Van der Kwast. The course is NOT giving a full explanation and road-map on uncertainty assessment, but provides purely an introduction.

The course was structured in three parts:

1. *You know the uncertain inputs and want to propagate them*
2. *You don't know the uncertain inputs, but you want to get an idea on the potential impact on model output*
3. *You don't know the uncertain parameter values, but have (uncertain) data to evaluate the model performance*
